# Next Steps

## After the Lab – Try mirrord Locally

Once you’ve completed the lab environment, you can continue experimenting with **mirrord** directly on your local machine.  
Getting started is simple — you only need the **mirrord CLI** or an **IDE plugin** (for example, for VS Code or IntelliJ).  
The **mirrord operator** is already managed and maintained by the **COP team**, so no additional setup in the cluster is required.
